# Student-Dashboard--Wireframe-Design-
A streamlined wireframe design for a student-centric dashboard, created for Accredianâ€™s product management challenge. This interface fosters peer collaboration through integrated study rooms, tracks group project progress, and organizes upcoming academic reminders, enhancing student engagement without relying on external tools.

The wireframe has been designed using **Balsamiq**, a rapid low-fidelity wireframing tool that allows for intuitive, user-friendly interface mockups. Balsamiq was chosen to prioritize simplicity and ease of iteration, ensuring a clean and effective user experience.
